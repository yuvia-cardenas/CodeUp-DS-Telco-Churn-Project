# CodeUp-DS-Telco-Churn-Project

## Telco Churn ###

### Project Description

#### Telco is a for profit company that provides tv, internet, services to the public. 

### Project Goal
* Discover drivers of customer churn in Telco DataSet.

* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to classify customers as ending in churn or not ending in churn.

* Churn is defined as a customer that has cancelled (any or all) of their services.

* This information could be used to further our understanding of what makes a customer churn and how to avoid that outcome.

### Initial Thoughts

#### My initial hypothesis is that drivers of churn will be elements that either cause an outright cancellation of product/services or increase the likelihood of a customer churning.

### The Plan
* Aquire data from the CodeUp database
* Prepare data and create tailored columns from existing data
#### Explore data in search of drivers of customer churn
* Answer the following initial questions
* How often does customer churn occur?
* Does any specific feature directly affect customer churn?
* Does any combination of features directly affect customer churn?
#### Develop a Model to predict if a customer will churn
* Use drivers identified to build predictive models of different types
* Evaluate models on train and validate data
* Select the best model based on highest accuracy
* Evaluate the best model on test data

#### Draw conclusions

### Data Dictionary

### Steps to Reproduce
* Clone this repo.
* Acquire the data from Kaggle
* Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
* Run notebook

### Takeaways and Conclusions
Upsets occur in 1/3 of games
In games where the lower rated player moves first there is a 4% greater chance of an upset
Games that are rated have a 3% higher chance of an upset
Games with a "quick" time control (30 min or less) have about a 1 in 3 chance of upset
Games with a "slow" time control (60 min or more) have about a 1 in 5 chance of upset
The mean rating of players in a game is not a driver of upsets
The difference in player rating is a driver of upsets
A player's choice of opening is a driver of upsets, however its influence is complicated and I would need more time to discover what role it plays
Recommendations
To increase the skill intensity of a game add to the length of time players are able to consider their moves
Based on the data longer time controls make it less likely for a less skilled player to beat a more skilled player
