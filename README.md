# CodeUp-DS-Telco-Churn-Project

### Read Me ###

# Telco is a company that provides tv, internet, services. 

# Project Goal
# Discover drivers of customer churn in Telco DataSet.

# Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to classify customers as 
# ending in churn or not ending in churn.

# Churn is defined as a customer that has cancelled (any or all) of their services.
# This information could be used to further our understanding of 
# what makes a customer churn and how to avoid that outcome.

# Initial Thoughts
# My initial hypothesis is that drivers of churn will be elements that 
# either cause an outright cancellation of product/services or increase the 
# likelihood of a customer churning.

# The Plan
# Aquire data from the CodeUp database

# Prepare data

# Create Engineered columns from existing data

# Explore data in search of drivers of customer churn
